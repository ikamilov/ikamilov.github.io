      <p>CPU Process Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS; SJN; SRT; ROUND ROBIN; EDF; This program is stimulating those algorithms cycle by cycle. A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling Shortest Remaining Time(SRT) Round Robin(RR) Scheduling Earliest Deadline First(EDF).</p>
